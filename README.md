#### Unified "My Account" Dashboard
Bridged a modern React frontend with legacy MySQL databases to create a unified dashboard.
* **Features:** Patrons can now view **Room Reservations** and **Event Registrations** directly in the app.
* **Impact:** Reduced friction for users managing bookings on mobile devices.

#### ISBN Camera Search
Developed a camera-based search feature to digitize the physical library experience.
* **Functionality:** Users can scan a book's barcode to instantly find it in the catalog, or manually enter the ISBN.

#### Digital Resource Portal
Simplified access to third-party journals and databases.
* **Integration:** Aggregated external links (e.g., New York Times, Gale OneFile) into a unified "Online Access" modal.
